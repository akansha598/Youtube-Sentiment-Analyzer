@rahul1216singh,"Drumstick is the fruit of what you&#39;ll know as moringa.<br>USA has a tendency to change names and act like it&#39;s unique to them when they start marketing it.<br>Drumstick became moringa, brinjal became eggplant, ladies fingers became okra, and many such more."

@aquibmohd,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu7hB_8kgcI&amp;t=454"">7:34</a> &quot;common way to eat that is with a pao &quot; what an absolute lie.  <br>It&#39;s not common <br>It&#39;s not a way <br>You&#39;re misleading people."
@bengtal,"Jains including potatoes in their list of vegetables to avoid (in trying to avoid killing the entirety of a plant rather than just &quot;borrowing&quot; some of its productions like leaves/fruits that can allow the plant to continue) is actually a departure from the original spirit and intention behind choosing what they will or won&#39;t eat. What I mean is that, while all the other root-vegetables mentioned constitute the ENTIRE root of that plant, thus meaning the whole plant dies when that vegetable is uprooted, potatoes can be different. Potatoes form, multiple/many potatoes potentially, at various points throughout the root-system of a single plant. You can actually dig gently (or even not-so-gently lol) into the soil around a potato plant, and feel quite a few potatoes that you can pluck up/out of the soil without really harming the plant. Actually, if your soil is loose enough, and plant is strong, you can probably pull the whole plant up, and remove every single tuber/potato, or at least the biggest harvest-worthy ones, as long as you leave as much roots as possible, and at least leave the origin/root-of-the-roots lol. You can then replant that potato plant, and even if it wilts for a few days at first, will probably just get going again, possibly becoming even more awesome."

@MikePaton-Williams-yv9qo,"That food factory is stupendous. I feel ashamed. In the 70s my expensive public school would bring a handful of us to London to work the Soup Run. Once a month we were allowed to stay up all night bringing hot soup and rolls to homeless people. Some of these folk would be sleeping over the kitchen grills of top tier, central London hotels to get the warmth. A humbling experience for us kids but in no way comparable to what India is doing today. Respect🙏🏽🙏🏽👍"

I definitely think you should give Nicaragua a shot! I&#39;ve been 3 different times and upon my first visit I fell in love with the country!!! It&#39;s an absolute paradise on Little Corn Island! Everyone speaks English, there&#39;s unlimited CLEAN drinking water, so many nationalities on the island at any time, and it&#39;s so inexpensive to travel there!!! Plus the food is on point. There&#39;s one concrete foot path on the island. North of the harbor, there&#39;s a few bars. The old lady who lives on that foot path frys up chicken and sliced fried plantains, she starts around 10pm and closes when she sells out and she sells out every night! OMG it&#39;s soooo good!!!"

@JB-ef7ks,"5 minute mark the guy putting them together has one hand with a glove n the other without 😅<br>What makes this so important isn&#39;t just the hygiene from the ungloved but the fact that it&#39;s his LEFT HAND which in South East Asia is the one they use to wipe their asses cause toilet paper isn&#39;t normally part of their cultural defecation process cause they don&#39;t really have indoor plumbing, hence the insult of shaking hands with their left hand!!!😂"

@XxGamer,This could&#39;ve been on the Main Channel.

What you are wanting me to do? And how does you smell so good??&quot;<br><br>Trust me, their English grammar isn&#39;t great, but if you read that statement with a thick Indian accent (in your head... aloud it sounds a bit racist) it is SPOT ON! <br><br> 🤣😂<br>But seriously, I&#39;ve made a ton of Indian friends. They&#39;re genuinely great people for the most part. There are some... backwards and bad practices they have that are still somewhat prominent in their culture (like rape gangs, near-zero rights for women [kinda based], and street pooping... Also &quot;bathing&quot; in the same river that a million people defecate into if the streets are too full)."

I dont mean to disrespect anyone from other cultures or countires, but this is an amazing idea and we should also be doing it here in the US if we can."
@teleman07,Poo jokes making themselves. No need to even phrase them.
@adamluhring2482,"When asked how the food is so cheap, the answer given is automation and scale - but that can&#39;t be the explanation for $0.02 meals, two of which are sufficient to feed someone in a day. In America, 2000 calories worth of potatoes at wholesale would be $3.53, with no money going to prep, seasoning, heating, transportation, etc. Economies of scale are helpful, but they won&#39;t cancel out all overhead and <b>then</b> make something 1/176 the price. The real difference here has to involve either subsidies or underpaid farmers."

@ericmorrison278,"God, I love this so much. Cooking is one of my favorite things, especially if it serves others. I worked multiple fast food services, and at each one, I cultivated a following of people who would only come in if I was working. I took my service role as an opportunity to try changing the vibes at most fast-food stores. I knew if I ever were to run my own restaurant, I would help those in need with food. This stuff they do in India is fucking awesome. That&#39;s real unity there."

@Thuglife-qg8ei,Bro next time eat samosa with chatni or chana
@andrewall3193,One thing about Indian food to note…. It’s always well seasoned
@melissadunton3534,"Excellent. I love seeing a spotlight being shown on the clean and hygienic food that is available in India. And of course seeing how much the charity does with feeding ppl was just beautiful. <br>We need something like that in the US. I’m a frequent flyer in the hospital and the amount of money spent on food by my loved ones over the years is ridiculous. Most hospitals will allow you ONE tray for a family member. It’s not free, it still get billed to you. Nothing in America is free. But if they’re charging it to your insurance anyway I don’t see why you can’t order as many extra trays as you’d like. It’s all politics. We would be so much better off with a charity like this…to come in to hospitals and serve up a free or even extremely discounted meal."
@saumyasrg,India is an experience
@Chef_Kordian,jesus that is the most hygienic place in india i think xd

@sADYc,"The plate is nothing like we eat in the North-West Europe, we have a limit, per household, when frozen pizza is on discount. Our frozen pizza is exactly how it sounds: something with no resemblance to real ingredients. It costs 5$ per 550g and is often discounted to 3$. This is what means to be rich, not eating real food and way overpay for it!😅 (for my Indian friends, I am being sarcastic, the plate and food looks absolutely amazing and seeing how is made it makes me happy  for you and really sad for me; more vitamin D please, summer should be here, in about 5 months from now)😂"
